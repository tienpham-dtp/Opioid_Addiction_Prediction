Since this is medical data, I am not allowed to share or show the data. 
The goal of this project is to clean and re-organize the data. 
A brief description for this dataset:
- 20 columns with 6+ millions rows
- The columns have mixture of messy data so it is required that I must reorganize and clean and remove the data into clean separate columns based on a given data dictionary
- These are the columns: 
id	event_descr	event_attr1	event_attr2	event_attr3	event_attr4	event_attr5	event_attr6	event_attr7	event_attr8	event_attr9	event_attr10	Days	PAY_DAY_SUPPLY_CNT	PAYABLE_QTY	MME	DRUG_TYPE	Specialty	Specialty2	Specialty3
